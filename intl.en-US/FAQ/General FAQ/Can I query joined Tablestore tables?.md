# Can I query joined Tablestore tables?

No. Tablestore does not support queries based on joined tables. You can combine Tablestore with Data Lake Analytics \(DLA\) and use standard SQL statements that are compatible with most SQL syntax of MySQL 5.7 to analyze data in Tablestore. For more information, see [DLA-based analysis of data in Tablestore by using SQL statements](https://yq.aliyun.com/articles/618501).
