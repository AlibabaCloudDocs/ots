# Case studies

This topic provides a variety of case studies to help you gain insight into Tablestore.

## Big data storage and analysis

Tablestore provides cost-effective, low-latency, and high-concurrency storage of and online access to large amounts of data. In addition, Tablestore provides incremental and full data tunnels as well as SQL syntax-based read and write on big data analysis platforms such as MaxCompute. An efficient incremental streaming read operation is provided for easy computing of real-time data streams.

## Social feed stream storage

Tablestore can store large amounts of social information generated by interactions between people, including feed stream information such as instant messaging \(IM\) chats, comments, threads, and likes. Tablestore charges resources based on pay-as-you-go. Tablestore can meet the needs of applications that feature significant traffic fluctuations and high concurrency while low latency is required and costs are minimized. Tablestore stores image and video objects in OSS. You can accelerate the speed of accessing these objects by using CDN.

## IoV data storage

A single table can store petabytes of data without distributing data to separate databases and tables, which simplifies the business logic. The schema-free data model enables easy access to the monitored data of different vehicle-mounted devices. Tablestore can be seamlessly integrated with multiple platforms for big data analytics and real-time computing services for ease of real-time online queries and business report analysis.
