# Read/write throughput {#concept_e5y_nmj_bfb .concept}

The read/write throughput is measured by read/write capacity units \(CUs\), which is the smallest billing unit for the data read and write operations.

-   One read CU indicates that 4 KB data is read from the table.

-   One write CU indicates that 4 KB data is written into the table.

-   Data smaller than 4 KB during the operation is rounded up to the nearest CU. For example, writing 7.6 KB data consumes two write CUs, and reading 0.1 KB data consumes one read CU.


When applications use an API to perform Table Store read/write operations, the corresponding amount of read/write CUs is consumed.

## Reserved throughput {#section_phr_gcg_cfb .section}

The reserved read/write throughput is an attribute of a table. When creating a table, the application specifies the read/write throughput reserved for the table. Configuring the reserved read/write throughput does not affect the tableâ€™s access performance and service capability.

For reserved throughput billing, the reserved throughput value is always used to calculate the hourly fee even if an application consumes less than the specified amount of throughput.

For example, suppose that an application reads 3 KB of data per record and 80 records per second from a table. In this case, the application consumes 80 capacity units per second.

If you set the reserved read throughput to 80 capacity units per second, the hourly fee is calculated by using the following formula: Hourly Fee = 80 reserved read throughput capacity units x Hourly Price for Reserved Read Throughput. It is enough for 288000 \(80 x 3600 seconds\) reads per hour.

**Note:** 

-   Reserved read/write throughput can be set to zero.
-   When the reserved read/write throughput is greater than zero, Table Store assigns and reserves enough resources for the table according to this configuration to guarantee low resource costs.
-   For a non-zero reserved read/write throughput, your Table Store service is billed even if no read and write requests are made. To guarantee billing accuracy, Table Store limits the maximum reserved read/write throughput to 5000 CUs per table \(neither read throughput nor write throughput can exceed 5000 CUs\). If you require more than 5000 CUs of reserved read/write throughput for a single table, Open a ticket to increase the throughput.
-   The reserved read/write throughput of a non-existent table is regarded as zero. To access a non-existent table, one additional read CU or one additional write CU is consumed depending on the actual operation.

Applications dynamically modify the reserved read/write throughput configuration of the table through the UpdateTable operation.

## Additional throughput {#section_hvl_gdg_cfb .section}

The additional read/write throughput refers to the portion of the actual consumed read/write throughput that exceeds the reserved read/write throughput. Its refresh interval is one second.

In the following example, the reserved read throughput is set to 100 units. T0, T1, and T2 show the reserved read throughput and the additional read throughput that an application consumed in three consecutive seconds:

-   T0: The actual read throughput consumption is 120 units. The consumption of the reserved read throughput and the consumption of the additional read throughput are 100 units and 20 units, respectively.
-   T1: The actual read throughput consumption is 95 units. The consumption of the reserved read throughput and the consumption of the additional read throughput are 100 units and 0 units, respectively.
-   T2: The actual read throughput consumption is 110 units. The consumption of the reserved read throughput and the consumption of the additional read throughput are 100 units and 10 units, respectively.

In the three consecutive seconds, the consumption of the reserved read throughput is 100 units, and the total consumption of the additional read throughput is 30 units.

**Note:** Table Store uses the average value per hour to calculate the consumption of the reserved throughput and uses the total amount per hour to calculate the consumption of the additional throughput.

For the additional read/write throughput mode, it is difficult to estimate the amount of compute resources that need to be reserved for data tables. Table Store is required to provide sufficient service capability to effectively handle access traffic spikes. For this reason, the unit price of additional read/write throughput is higher than that of reserved read/write throughput. To make sure that low costs are maintained, we recommend that you set an appropriate value of the reserved read/write throughput.

**Note:** Because it is difficult to accurately reserve resources based on the additional read/write throughput, in extreme situations, Table Store may return an error OTSCapacityUnitExhausted to an application when an access to a single partition key consumes 10,000 CUs per second. In this case, policies such as backoff retry are used to reduce the frequency of access to the table.
